*** Description

Sift through keepassxc database entries and autotype the password directly in the input form with a hotkey.

*** Requirements

- [[https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc][keepassxc-cli]] (comes with default install; minimum version requirement >= 2.5.0)
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expect][Tcl + Expect]]
- [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][dmenu]] or [[https://github.com/davatorium/rofi][rofi]] (default)
- [[https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool][xdotool]]
- Graphical pinentry (default is pinentry-qt)
- Inability to figure out the browser plugin
- Not have Mossad as enemy

*** Usage

Provide a config file at =~/.config/keepassxc-dmenu/config= which should contain at least ~kp_database_path~ variable. This is just a tcl file which will be sourced. An example:

#+begin_src tcl
set kpxc_database_path $::env(HOME)/Passwords.kdbx
set kpxc_dmenu {rofi -dmenu -no-custom -i}
set kpxc_pinentry /usr/bin/pinentry-qt
# set kpxc_timeout 60
#+end_src

This is primarily meant to be invoked by pressing hotkey (either configured in the DE, or in a hotkey daemon such as [[https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd][sxhkd]]). An example for sxhkd may look:

#+begin_src txt
super + p
  [ -e /tmp/keepassxc-dmenu/run ] && echo y > /tmp/keepassxc-dmenu/run || keepassxc-dmenu >/dev/null 2>&1

super + alt + p
  echo exit > /tmp/keepassxc-dmenu/run
#+end_src
